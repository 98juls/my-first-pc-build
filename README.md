# my-first-pc-build

1. Overview
Built my first custom PC to improve my hardware knowledge, practice troubleshooting, and support future IT help desk projects. This build helped me strengthen my understanding of system components and prepare for more advanced networking and IT learning.

2. Component List
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5500 (AM4)

GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050

RAM: 16GB DDR4

Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD
